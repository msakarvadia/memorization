# Data

- `pythia_mem_data` points to the memorized data that we evaluated the Pythia 2.8B/6.9B models on. We used the data publically released by: https://github.com/terarachang/MemPi/tree/main/data/pile/EleutherAI
- `old_data.py` is how we generate training data for training our TinyMem models. Do `old_data.py --help` to see full script arguments.
