This directory contains the implementations for all three regularizers we considered in this study.

- `dropout.py` contains the implementation for "example-tied-dropout". We closely followed the implementation from: https://github.com/pratyushmaini/localizing-memorization/blob/main/models/dropout.py
- `dropper.py` contains the implementation for "loss truncation". We closely followed the implementation from: https://github.com/ddkang/loss_dropper/tree/master
- `spectral_reg.py` contains the implementation for "spectral norm regularizer". We closely followed the implementation from: https://github.com/pfnet-research/sngan_projection
