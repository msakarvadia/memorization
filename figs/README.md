# Figure Creation Scripts
- [`vis`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/tree/main/figs/vis) contains directions for generating loss landscapes
- [`csv`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/tree/main/figs/csv) contains the results for the TinyMem unlearning experiments
- any `*.pdf` is a figure that we created (not all figures are final and included in the paper). See paper for the latest figures.
- [`Visualization_Notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/Visualization_Notebook.ipynb) details how to load in a trained TinyMem model and do inference on it
- [`all_pythia_unlearning_runs.csv`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/all_pythia_unlearning_runs.csv) contains all of the unlearning results for the Pythia models
- [`best_pythia_unlearning_runs.csv`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/best_pythia_unlearning_runs.csv) contains the best HP runs for each unlearning result for the Pythia models
- [`pythia_unlearning_results.ipynb`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/pythia_unlearning_results.ipynb) contains code to process all of the Pythia unlearning experimental results
