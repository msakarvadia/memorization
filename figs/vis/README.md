# Loss Landscape Visualization

Notebooks to compute and visualize loss landscapes for the production-grade language models.


- [`loss_landscapes.ipynb`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/vis/loss_landscapes.ipynb) includes code for loading pythia models and computing loss landscapes
- [`plot_loss_landscapes.ipynb`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/vis/plot_loss_landscapes.ipynb) includes code for (re-)plotting (pre-computed) loss landscape data
- [`loss_landscape_files`](https://github.com/msakarvadia/memorization/blob/main/figs/vis/loss_landscape_files) includes example loss landscape files and corresponding visualizations
